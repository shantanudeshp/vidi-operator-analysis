October 7 todos:

Use PSD plots

Sampling interval = 0.05



Nperseg = granularity


__Grinding:__

Isolate frequency peaks ie. t2_b btw 3-6 (start with magnitude vector, later can do with individual axes)

Reconstruct signal on time domain

At what timestamps do we see the frequencies of interest

Inverse Fourier





Plot psd for each axis individually






Arrangement:

T1 without visual assistance

T2 with visual assistance









Organize GitHub repo:

Images to store result of previous experiments
